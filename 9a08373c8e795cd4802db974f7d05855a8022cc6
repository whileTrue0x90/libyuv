      "message": "A profile on Pixel 4\n64.76%,  InterpolateRow_16To8_C\n25.52%,  Convert16To8Row_NEON\n\nshows the C code is a bottleneck.\nCompared to other conversions it is in the middle\nI210ToI410_Opt (590 ms)\nI210ToI010_Opt (272 ms)\nI210ToI420_Opt (365 ms)  \u003c-- new function\nI210ToI422_Opt (227 ms)\n\nBut it should be faster than I210ToI422.\nIf assembly is not written, it would be better to refactor the function to use I210ToI422 internally to convert a row at a time to a temporary buffer (using NEON) and then merge 2 rows of I422 to make I420, also with NEON/AVX.\n\nIf NEON is written but not AVX2, the code can also do both - have a 1 step conversion for NEON and 2 step for AVX2.  Typically 2 steps works better for Intel than ARM.\n\nWe can still go ahead with this CL as is, establishing the API and aim to improve performance in a follow up\n",
